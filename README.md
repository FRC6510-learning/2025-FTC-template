Pymble 2025 Learning template repository

This repository is derived from [this
template](https://github.com/Dairy-Foundation/Templates/tree/teamcode-sloth).

I recommend checking out the [readme
branch](https://github.com/Dairy-Foundation/Templates/tree/readme).

Students are likely to have network issues building this repository, they will
need to connect to a hotspot or similar in order for many gradle related
downloads to go through.

You will need to install a version 1.8 JDK on all computers that use it. Android
studio makes this fairly easy.

Follow [this
guide](https://cookbook.dairy.foundation/gradle/downgrading_gradle_jdk/downgrading_gradle_jdk.html)
to find the settings page to download a version 1.8 JDK. Unlike in this guide,
you must not select to use the version 1.8 JDK, but rather change back to using
the `GRADLE_LOCAL_JAVA_HOME` option.

As above, this operation will likely fail on school wifi.
